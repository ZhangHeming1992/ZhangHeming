<p>Assume that：there is such a thing called "time" that can be measured by math,</p>
<p>or we can say that: "assumption: time exists in math".</p>
<p>Then math will have timeliness，which means the past is known, and the future is unknown.</p>
<p>Thinking about "1+1=2".</p>
<p>When a program is dealing with "1+1".</p>
<p>Is "2" existing right now?</p>
